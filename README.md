# Get-Me-Home
A mobile app that provides driving directions without the internet

## Motivation
1. This app uses the wireless technologies of SMS and GPS to obtain driving directions in areas of limited WiFi and Cellular Data connectivity.
2. Cellular Data, even when available, is more expensive and less reliable compared to SMS, especially in rural areas and outside the United States.
3. Short messaging Service (SMS) is a text messaging service that allows users to send and receive messages through their mobile devices and applications. The reliability of SMS services makes it a preferable service for a critical task such as finding directions. Being lost in an unknown area can pose a large danger to drivers.
4. Global Positioning System (GPS) is a global navigation satellite system that uses geolocation and time estimations via satellites to provide directions to the receiver. This wireless technology, which is not dependent on Internet connectivity, can be used to locate the coordinates of the user and to draw out a route for the user to provide directions via SMS with the help of a server.
